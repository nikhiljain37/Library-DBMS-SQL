# Library-DBMS-SQL
In this project, I developed a Library Management System using SQL to showcase my skills in database management. The system consists of four tables: Authors, Books, Members, and Loans.

The Author's table holds information about various authors, including their names and birth years. The Books table contains details about different books, including their titles, associated authors, genres, and publication years. The Members table tracks library members and their join dates, while the Loans table records information about borrowed books, including loan and return dates.

I populated the database with a selection of ten books, including notable Indian authors like Chetan Bhagat, Arundhati Roy, R.K. Narayan, and Ruskin Bond, ensuring a diverse representation of literature. The project includes various SQL queries demonstrating key functionalities.

These queries allow users to retrieve books by Indian authors, count the total number of books, update member information, delete specific books, and count how many books were published after the year 2000. I also included a query to list all members who joined the library in 2023.

Creating this project enhanced my understanding of relational databases and SQL syntax. It helped me practice essential database operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data. This hands-on experience not only reinforced my technical skills but also improved my problem-solving abilities as I implemented the logic for managing the library system effectively. Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the practical applications of SQL in real-world scenarios.
